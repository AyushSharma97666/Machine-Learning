# Machine Learning Algorithms Overview

## Overview
Machine learning algorithms are computational methods that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every task. These algorithms are designed to identify patterns or trends in data and use them to make predictions or decisions.

### Types of Machine Learning Algorithms

1. **Supervised Learning**: 
   - In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data, where each example is paired with a label or outcome. It learns to predict the label for new, unseen data based on patterns observed in the training data. Examples include:
     - [Linear Regression](linear_regression.ipynb)
     - [Logistic Regression](./machine_learning_algorithms/logistic_regression.ipynb)
     - [Decision Trees](./machine_learning_algorithms/decision_trees.ipynb)
     - [Random Forests](./machine_learning_algorithms/random_forests.ipynb)
     - [Support Vector Machines](./machine_learning_algorithms/support_vector_machines.ipynb)
     - [Neural Networks](./machine_learning_algorithms/neural_networks.ipynb)
   
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: 
   - Unsupervised learning algorithms work with unlabeled data, where the algorithm tries to find hidden patterns or structures within the data. Examples include:
     - [K-means Clustering](./machine_learning_algorithms/k_means_clustering.ipynb)
     - [Hierarchical Clustering](./machine_learning_algorithms/hierarchical_clustering.ipynb)
     
3. **Semi-supervised Learning**: 
   - This type of learning combines elements of both supervised and unsupervised learning. It uses a small amount of labeled data along with a large amount of unlabeled data to improve learning accuracy.

4. **Reinforcement Learning**: 
   - In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Examples include:
     - [Q-learning](./machine_learning_algorithms/q_learning.ipynb)
     - [Deep Q-Networks (DQN)](./machine_learning_algorithms/dqn.ipynb)

5. **Deep Learning**: 
   - Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to learn representations of data. Examples include:
     - [Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)](./machine_learning_algorithms/cnns.ipynb)
     - [Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)](./machine_learning_algorithms/rnns.ipynb)

6. **Ensemble Learning**: 
   - Ensemble learning combines multiple machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy. Techniques such as bagging, boosting, and stacking are used to train multiple models and combine their predictions.
